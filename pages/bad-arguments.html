<h1>Bad Arguments</h1>
<p>If you see someone making a bad argument, you can link to any of the specific arguments on this page.</p>
<p><em>WARNING:</em> These tags may have the opposite effect that you intended. They have the effect of shaming the person "tagged", which can completely derail any chance at having a constructive conversation. These are best used on public figures that show a pattern of bad faith online, or to explain the concepts of good and bad faith to someone, or, most productively, for your own reflection. Please read these, take them to heart, and take notice the next time you find yourself resorting to one of these tactics.</p>
