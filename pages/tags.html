<h2>Tags</h2>

<p>
    We have provided for you some standard responses that you can use in social media discussions online.
    When you see someone behaving badly by using bad arguments, or worse, acting in intentionally bad faith, don't yell
    back!
    Instead, keep your cool, respond with a link to one of the pages in Bad Arguments, and calmly explain how they may
    do better next time.
</p>
<p>
    On those rare occasions that someone is acting in surprisingly good faith, congratulate them with a link to one of
    our Good Behavior tags!
    People like to feel good, and encouragement works better than shaming. The carrot is more powerful than the stick!
