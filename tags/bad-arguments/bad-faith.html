title: "Bad Faith"
description: "Whether you consider yourself a religious person or not, it doesn't matter. You are obviously acting in BAD FAITH. We are trying to have a useful debate here in order to understand the situation better, but it seems that you are putting the victory of your personal preconceptions before that. If you cannot discuss the situation honestly, I ask you to please not contribute any more. Your comments are taking us one step farther from the right solution."
