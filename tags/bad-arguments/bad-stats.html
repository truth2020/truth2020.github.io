title: "Bad Stats"
description: "There's lies, damned lies, andâ€¦ well, actually, statistics are a very important part of trying to understand the big picture, and I appreciate that you have contributed some to this discussion. Unfortunately, either your interpretation of these statistics seems incorrect to me, or you have omitted some of the stats which would go against the point you are trying to make."
