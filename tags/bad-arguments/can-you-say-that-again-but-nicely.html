title: "Can You Say That Again, But Nicely?"
description: "You have some interesting points there that have enriched the general discussion. I thank you for that information. Unfortunately, you wrapped it all in a layer of insults for the same people that you are trying to convince. When you do that, it's counterproductive to your purpose, as those that are reading it will ignore the main point and respond instead to the insults. Please send us your information again, but this time showing the your readers the same respect that you would hope they give to your arguments."
