title: "Can't Have It Both Ways"
description: "You appear to be complaining about something when it's done by one side, while encouraging it when it benefits your own. Take a step back and decide: is this behavior unacceptable? If so, stand against it and call it out no matter who is doing it. That's how we make for a better society. If not, it's time to stop complaining."
