title: "Correlation Is Not Causation"
description: "You are making an argument based on the correlation of two phenomena, and are implying that one causes the other. However, you have failed to provide any relevant evidence showing that this is indeed the case. Until such proof is provided, it would be better to retract your argument, as it may be incorrectly biasing the opinions of others."
