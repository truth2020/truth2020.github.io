title: "Fake Question"
description: "You seem to be asking a question for which you already know the answer. I'm guessing you are pretending to be naive in order to leave those less informed than you to fill in the blanks with an answer that is worse than the truth. I hope my answer can help to return a little honesty to this discussion."
