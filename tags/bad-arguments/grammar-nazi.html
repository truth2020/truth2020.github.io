title: "Grammar Nazi"
description: "Godwin's Law states that the longer an online discussion goes, the greater the chance that someone will mention Hitler and/or Nazis in order to prove their point. A second, unspoken law is that whenever someone misspells something online, someone else will use that as proof that they are unworthy of debate. The truth is, everyone misspells things from time to time in their rush to post online. Let's get back to the main debate!"
