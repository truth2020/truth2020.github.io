title: "Lonely Anecdote"
description: "I understand that people can connect to issues easier on a personal level than when confronted with statistics. However, you seem to be using hand-picked anecdotes as a replacement for a more serious consideration of the pros and cons of this debate. My understanding of the overall context is that your anecdote represents the exception rather than the rule. Could you please help me tie this to the big picture?"
