description: "It seems that you have used one of the #Truth2020 in an effort to shame someone else rather than engaging with them in a peaceful conversation. The effect of this was to derail the conversation rather than to teach or encourage. Please be more careful in your use of these tags - the goal is to reach across lines and to set good examples for how to hold constructive debates."
