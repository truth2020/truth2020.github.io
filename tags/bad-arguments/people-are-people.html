title: "People Are People"
description: "When you place your fellow Americans into a box and pretend they're all the same, &quot;they&quot; win. Who are &quot;they&quot;? I don't know, but &quot;they&quot; certainly aren't <em>US</em>. If you still believe that America has the best system around, please take a deep breath and treat people like the individuals they are, before we lose it once and for all."
