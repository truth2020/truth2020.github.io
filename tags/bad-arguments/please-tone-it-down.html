title: "Please Tone It Down"
description: "Well, that escalated quickly! We're trying to have a constructive discussion here, but the way you are phrasing your arguments sounds unnecessarily accusatory or aggressive. Could you please try to frame things for what they are, so that people can respond to the actual content of your argument rather than the way it was said?"
