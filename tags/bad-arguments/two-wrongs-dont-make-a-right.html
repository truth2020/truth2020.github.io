title: "Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right"
description: "You are basing at least part of your arguments on what others have done in the past. While you may or may not have a point, a wrong committed in the past does not justify a wrong in the future. Let's please take a step back and look at the situation with fresh eyes to decide what would be the best course of action now, without consideration for revenge or past injustices. In exchange, we agree to demand that those that committed past injustices do their part to make amends, for the good of all."
