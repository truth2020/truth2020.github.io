title: "What If the Tables Were Turned?"
description: "You have made some pretty strong condemnations of your subject. I do agree with one or more of the things you have said. However, I'm concerned that your condemnations are not coming from a place of moral offense, but rather for political advantage. If the tables were turned, and the accusations were made against one of the people you support, would you speak as loudly? Given previous behavior, I have serious doubts regarding this. It might do us all some good to reflect on which is more important: demanding the same standards of all people, or using them selectively for temporary political gains."
