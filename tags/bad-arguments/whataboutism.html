description: "Rather than respond to the issue being discussed, you are bringing up a separate issue in an attempt to prove there is hypocrisy, or otherwise disctract from the current issue. Everyone is familiar with the idea that two wrongs do not make a right. Let's focus on the current topic, and then we can think, separately, about what you have said."
