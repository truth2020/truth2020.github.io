title: "Who Do You Believe?"
description: "You seem to be doubting all of our sources of information. It is good to have some level of skepticism, but are your doubts based on contradictory evidence, or just on a general mistrust of anything said by our sources? If you have better evidence, please send it for us to see, along with information as to why your sources should be more trusted than the ones seen so far. These are difficult times when so much mistrust has been sewn, so let's work together to find the hard evidence."
