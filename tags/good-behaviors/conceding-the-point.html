title: "Conceding the Point"
description: "You just admitted in public that you were wrong about something. Not only is it ok to change your mind in the face of new information, it's the right thing to do! We understand that our opinions aren't written stone, but are what we think `for now`, given our current information. Thank you for being humble and honest, and for making the Internet a more constructive place!"
